# Garkov

A generator of nonsensical [Garfield](https://www.garfield.com) strips that uses
[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to fill the speech bubbles with more or less incoherent text.

I got the inspiration from [Josh Millard's generator](http://joshmillard.com/garkov) of the same name.
He also let me use some of his source text. </p>
